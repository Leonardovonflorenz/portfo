            <h3>Further study- Procurement controlling </h3>
            <p>
              The Purchasing and Logistics / Supply Chain Managementt master's programme is a part-time professional
              program offered by the OHM Professional School (OPS). The OHM Professional School is the Business School
              within the Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm (Nuremberg Tech). It is dedicated exclusively to
              the provision of higher education geared towards international business.</p>

            <p>
              <b>Procurement controlling</b> is often viewed as part of a larger domain known as spend management which
              incorporates
              <b>spend analysis,</b> commodity management, industry spend benchmarking, and strategic sourcing.
              Companies
              perform a spend analysis for several reasons. The core business driver for most organizations is
              profitability. In addition to improving compliance and reducing cycle times, performing detailed spend
              analysis helps companies find new areas of savings that previously went untapped, and hold on to past
              areas of savings that they have already negotiated.

              There are three core areas of spend analysis - visibility, analysis, and process. By leveraging all three,
              companies can generate answers to the crucial questions affecting their spending, including: What am I
              really spending? With whom am I spending it? Am I getting what was promised for that spend?

              The Institute of Industrial Engineers defines Industrial Engineering as that field of knowledge and
              professional performance that refers to the design, improvement and installation of integrated systems of
              people, materials, information, equipment and energy for the production of goods and services. Industrial
              Engineering is based on expertise and skills in the mathematical, physical and social sciences, in
              addition to principles and methods of analysis and design in engineering, all of which allow me to
              specify, predict and evaluate the results to be obtained from the systems.</p>
